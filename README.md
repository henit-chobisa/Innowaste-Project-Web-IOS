# The Problem :

- The tendency of ignorance of waste management in day to day households.

- Only 5% of waste is recycled every year from the total waste which is a very less number.
 
- There is nothing which unites us together for the betterment of Earth and Environment is the only thing that holds an ability to hold us together as an species.
- There are not proper opportunities available to people that can motivate them daily for protection of environment and cleanliness.

---


- There is not a single steam exist which motivates the brands for production of reclycled materials and new products.
